Crash Site is a data input tool which allows road users to catalogue crashes that may not have been reported in traditional police report systems. 

In this version, data is entered on the command line and exports to a central CSV file for future analysis.

---

date_crash = Date the crash occurred.
time_crash = Time (approximate) that the crash occurred. Because this program assumes that the user will be inputting data 
city_crash = City in which the crash occurred.

veh1_crash = Value associated with user input related to the type of vehicle they were operating. Users are asked: "What kind of vehicle were you driving, or were you walking?" 
Responses are coded into numbers:
	1 - Bike/bicycle
	2 - Walking
	3 - Car
	4 - Motorcycle
	5 - Unicycle
	6 - Skateboard
Other responses are marked with the phrase "unusual input" as well as the entry text.


veh2_crash = Users first answer "Was the crash with another vehicle or an object?"; if vehicle, "What kind of vehicle?"
Responses are coded into numbers:
	1 - Bike/bicycle
	2 - Walking
	3 - Car
	4 - Motorcycle
	5 - Unicycle
	6 - Skateboard
Other responses are marked with the phrase "unusual input" as well as the entry text. 

crash_obj = If user answers "object", input text is listed with "Object:"

date_crash = Date the crash occurred.
